##### Abstract

Simulated child-robot interaction offers ways to test robot behaviors before real-world trials with vulnerable populations. At the same time, this type of simulation requires realistic models of child behavior. We combined cognitive science research on infant attention with real-world child-robot interaction data to develop two behavior tree-based models of child behavior (i.e., robot-interested and robotuninterested). We evaluated these models through a video-based study (N = 60). Participants rated the proposed models as more familiar, humanlike, and natural than a control (random behavior) model. This work can support related work on child-robot interaction, as well as broader efforts on using technology to support infant development.
