##### Abstract

Clinicians working with children with motor disabilities can benefit from incorporating robots into clinical practice. However, there is a lack of research on cliniciansâ€™ perspectives for using robots with different levels of autonomy in these spaces. In this work, we conducted semi-structured interviews with N = 11 clinicians, including physical, occupational, and speech language therapists, to understand their unique perspectives and trust levels of using robots in pediatric interventions. The results of our interviews showed that clinicians had minimal experience with robots, but were excited and curious to learn more about the capabilities of a robot. Additionally, clinicians displayed skepticism about trusting a robot with either partial or full autonomy. These key
insights from clinicians may shape new design considerations for roboticists in the child-robot interaction space.
